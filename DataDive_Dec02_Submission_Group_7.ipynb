       "      <td>I have been getting sushi from Banzai Sushi  since it opened about 10 years ago. Sushi is always very consistent and fresh. The owners (who seem to be a couple) are always prepared to make a type of sushi that they may not on display. Just ask! The pricing is very reasonable, $3.50 for 6 pieces of any type of sushi. The sushi pieces are also quite large, which gives you true value for money. \\n\\nThe owner also sells imported soda from the US, such as Vanilla Coke or Cherry Coke which I love. Overall, I have never had a bad experience here. Very low key, but great, it is always great tasting and FRESH! \\n\\nIf you are in the area, go in an pick up some sushi, soup or a bento box. You can take it home or eat it at the tables in the area that was once a mall.</td>\n",

I mean who visits a place like that?\\n\\nWell, I did - and I totally LOVED it. This place is very hole in the wall, CASH only, minimal furniture and no decor. They serve up plates veyr quickly and have a process for it - be ready with your order when the guy asks - he goes fast through the toppings - you snooze, you lose! \\n\\nWe had the chicken shawarma plate - absolute best ever! Rice was tasty, chicken was tender, flavorful and moist - loved every bite of it!\\n\\nWe ended up using american money bec I am the hightailing chick who decides every place must use a credit card, and the guy charged us like Canadian money - which means I lost a few dollars, but hey - the food was delicious, so no complains!</td>\n",

       "668841  On paper, this place has NOTHING going for it - middle of no where in an industrial area, part of the same lot as a gas station and auto body shops, on a highway that attracts 18 ton trailers way more than cars. I mean who visits a place like that?\\n\\nWell, I did - and I totally LOVED it. This place is very hole in the wall, CASH only, minimal furniture and no decor. They serve up plates veyr quickly and have a process for it - be ready with your order when the guy asks - he goes fast through the toppings - you snooze, you lose! \\n\\nWe had the chicken shawarma plate - absolute best ever! Rice was tasty, chicken was tender, flavorful and moist - loved every bite of it!\\n\\nWe ended up using american money bec I am the hightailing chick who decides every place must use a credit card, and the guy charged us like Canadian money - which means I lost a few dollars, but hey - the food was delicious, so no complains!  \n",

The meatballs themselves were flavourful and not dry at all, they also came in a yummy sauce. The ravioli bites were the perfect blend of cheese and crunch and were delicious.

It had a fun rock vibe, very friendly staff, quick service and most importantly delicious food! There is music playing in the background, loud enough to notice but quiet enough that you can still talk easily without yelling. I got the Rock Candy Drink (Malibu Rum, Peach Schnapps, Mango & Passion Fruit Juices). Next up were appetizers, sweet & sour meatballs and ravioli bites! Both were delicious! The meatballs themselves were flavourful and not dry at all, they also came in a yummy sauce. The ravioli bites were the perfect blend of cheese and crunch and were delicious. The main course: Fleetwood MAC 'n cheese tater tots. The Mac and cheese was creamy and flavourful, the tater tots had the perfect amount of crunch. Would definitely go back again!  \n",
       "239805                                       I really do love this place! \\n\\nRight at the moment from entering, I felt welcomed, all the way until the time I left. Where you get a huge Japanese goodbye! And it really felt genuine too! \\n\\nService is outstanding as other Yelpers have said. The waitress even apologized for the long wait on the dessert which took me by surprise because I think only a minute passed by since I had ordered my dessert! \\n\\nI got the curry Katsu, and I loved it! (I've had a lot of curry katsu's in my time). Perfect crispy katsu, with rich thick curry sauce! \\n\\nMy boyfriend got the hamburger don, which was so so for him. But I really liked it! \\n\\nHe then got the green tea bruele and I had the Japanese special cake and they were both superb! \\n\\nI think it's a combination of the extremely friendly staff with a great atmosphere and fantastic food that has tied it all together for me. \\n\\nDefinitely recommended, and I will be back in the near future! I'm really happy I found this place while looking for places to eat at midnight! Haha xD  \n",

       "487433  It's a casual atmosphere so ditch the fancy gear and put on your most comfortable sweatpants and be prepared to EAT. \\nI've been here twice so far and both times the service was top notch with friendly staff (from the front desk to wait staff to the kitchen), a small and cozy atmosphere and plenty of character. \\nBut we come here for the food. \\nBarque's has been a magnet for Roncesvalles. Thanks to this restaurant it was my first time visiting the neighbourhood.\\nPlatter and individual options available. Best bet for two people is the current menu special where you can pick 1-2-3 : three meats, two sides, one appetizer. \\nDo yourself a favour and indulge in the Barque Obama (haha) ribs. Not too sticky, smoky and a hint of sweetness. \\nThe pulled pork (or was it chicken) was equally impressive. Brisket - never been a fan so I'll just rate it \"good\".\\nAlso do this for your tastebuds and a happy belly - the Cajun mac and cheese. Don't ask me no questions. Just order and enjoy. Thank me later. \\nIt's not Memphis BBQ but it's Toronto BBQ and it's done right.  \n",

I came here as a group with some of my peers for lunch and we all had a good time. I ordered the Calamari Fritti which tasted great, probably my favourite calamari next to the one at the Hazelton in Yorkville. The only complain I can think of regarding the food was that it was a bit too salty for my liking. But other than that it was fine.\\nThere was a little issue that came up during my visit with a staff member, but the manager (At least I think it was the manager) was very prompt to call me back and do whatever he could to fix the issue, so I commend him for that! Will definitely be coming back soon.  \n",

They also have lots of baked goods. \\n\\nThere are lots of tables, including a section in the back which is great because it means you can usually walk in and find somewhere to sit without waiting. \\n\\nThey offer drip coffee to go in a cool way. If you are in a rush you can fill up yourself pay with change without having to wait in line. \\n\\nThe crowd is a mix of young people, creative types and families with young kids.

Your burgers use to be the best around. We tried your new Angus Beef burgers which were dry, overcooked and tasteless. It was like you squeezed all the juice and flavour out of the burgers. Fries were overcooked and dry as well. I know good fries are double-fried but these were more than triple-fried. Your service is always friendly but food very disappointing this time.  \n",

The gyros were horrible the first time so I tried the falafels this time. Big mistake. Bland and stale seem to be the main ingredients for this place. It also took more than 10 minutes for them to make it too. I thought it was a fast food type place, not a sit-down type place judging by the name but I guess I was wrong. It's a shame because the owner seems quite nice. I just can't bring myself to give this place more than 1 star because the food is just so bad.  \n",

Man I feel like an ass, I apologize to the owners who are very nice people but COME ON, serve some proper food!!\\n\\nEverything tastes bad, but it's super cheap especially on their daily specials (usually prices $3-4).

       "668865  I am sorry, I tried. At least three times.\\n\\nIt's been awhile since I've been here, so I don't want to condemn them without a retrial, but I was left deeply dissatisfied with what I got every single time, back when they moved into this area. As I mentioned with Queenslice, I find their lack of focus represented in the signage- \"Toronto's #1 shawarma house!\"/\"the original philly style sandwich!\"/\"juice bar!\" to be indicative of greater problems in the kitchen.

The person serving coffee was really kind and came by every 15 minutes to top up coffee.\\n\\nWhen we placed our order, we were surprised that the food was taking a really long time.

It would've been a much more pleasant experience had the waiter brought bread or something to help carry us over until the food arrived when we had asked, but he had completely forgotten about us.\\n\\nThe manager at least comped us for the trouble and bad service.

       "      <td>The other reviewers were not wrong.  We were in Markham last night and needed to get a quick dinner. The menu in the window showed all the right menu items so we thought why not? It was not crowded so we thought it would be fast...bad mistake. \\nWe ordered for 2 adults and one child a combo for 2 and a 1 person combo.  Cold tofu with preserved egg was good but the idea of bringing side plates to eat a dish meant for sharing seemed foreign to the server. She needed to be asked 3 times and the first time she brought knife and fork instead. Oyster omelette had a big sign in the window. Hardly any oysters in it, not much egg either, mostly fried starch paste. Didn't eat the sauce. Beef noodle soup had small amounts of tough meat, pretty sad for a place that has beef noodle soup in its name. Shaved ice with mangoes was good. The server kept telling stories about how the patrons at the next table drive out of their way to eat theirs. She also had some choice comments about my son's body habitus, which no doubt she will be sharing with other patrons after we are gone. My son didn't like his chicken wing dinner. \\nService was slow....and rude. Each dish brought out at a different time, as if the kitchen could not cook one till it was finished cooking the previous. Drinks the same way. When we were done my husband waited 10 minutes after the server cleared the tables before he went up to find out what was going on. Server had our bill ready but didn't bother to bring it to our table. And the restaurant was mostly empty. Took us over 1 1/2 hours. Bill was over $70, no alcohol. They do not take credit cards so bring cash if you plan to eat here after reading this. We're not coming back.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Disappointed much?!\\n\\nI met a group of friends here Sunday afternoon, I was looking forward to this place as I had heard good things. The patio filled super quick given it had only just opened but that is not the bar's fault so we took a seat inside for cocktails, the Caesar was good! \\n\\nA few cocktails later we were hungry and  the food did look good. One of our group had eaten here before and said it was fine. So I started trying to obtain menu's. This was a considerable task as up until this point the service had been pretty rubbish and slow...it wan't that busy either. So after being ignored several times, I went and found menus for the table. \\n\\nWe decided on what we all would like to eat then waited about 15 minutes to get a server. The server only approached us as she wanted the menu's we had, I said we were ready to order and she said I will be back in 2 minutes to take the order...now don't get me wrong I did not expect her back in 2 minutes...but 10 minutes later and we are still getting ignored by her as she passes our table countless times...ridiculous. \\n\\nWe decided at this point to get the bill and leave, go get food elsewhere. Awful, awful service. I will not be returning any time soon</td>\n",

       "      <td>I sympathize with the other reviewers as i had a similar or worse experience today at this horrible place. I should have checked this page before going there. Anyway, i present the voucher and 5 min later the manager comes up to me and i could barely undeetand what he was saying as his english was like 1/10 but this is what i got from it.. They dont accept those vouchers anymore because of some dilemma they have with dealfind and they overbooked reservations or something. Should NOT be the customers concern. Anyway, just like the other reviewer said, they told me to go on the website and get a refund. DESPITE the hard time they gave us, we were hungry and decided to order anyway.. The weitress (whom may i add was either on a hard dose of methane or just really stoned, and also did not speak english nor could comprehend the menu at the restaurant where she works) had to come back 3 times and have me repeat my order because she couldnt be bothered to write it down the frst time...NOR the second or third.. It wasnt even as if we were ordering so much, only 3 damn items!! But she didnt even have a pen and a pad to begin with. On top of all that, when we came in and waited for a while for someone to seat us, no one did despite the fact that the restaurant was empty in the midst of a mid afternoon, we ended up seating ourselves. Yes i know there were red flags all around but cognitive dissonance prevented us from leaving until we were just literally fed up!!! And we never just up and leave.. Oh and when i asked about those complimentary apetizer plates, she didnt know what i was talking about. This place is hands down shit and i wouldnt recommed it to my worst enemy on earth. What a waste of time. Btw, i dont usually write reviews so you know this lengthy review is the outcome of severe devastation. Im also typing on my ipad which isnt as easy as on a regular keyboard. Anywho, the first red flag was the fact that all tables were EMPTY.. But its definately no surprise !!!!! The weitress herself told us this is not the first incident where people leave hungry and frustrated. Gee u think? I dont know how this place is still holding up quite honestly, but i can see it closing down very soon. I ended up writing to dealfind immediately, basically stating my frustration and demanding a freakin refund. STAY AWAY!!!!!!</td>\n",

WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER. Came here on a Friday night and the service was extremely slow. Our server was new and she got our order wrong and we waited extra time for our order to be correctly brought to the table. This place was so loud, you can barely hear when you talk to your guests. \\n\\nThe service was horrible. The server literally came over twice the whole dining experience. If she can't handle so many tables at once, maybe the management is to blame.\\n\\nSpoke to the manager in the purple/blue shirt and he was a joke. He was arrogant and refused to admit the restaurant server had any issues or the fact service was at a snail pace. \\n\\nThe restaurant is racist and does not care about anyone!\\n\\nWorst dining experience for overpriced food that was not even what we ordered! Pathetic that's all I can say!\\n\\nService 0/5\\nManagement 0/5\\nFood 1/5\\n\\nAvoid this place and don't ruin your night !  \n",

They were chatting with each other/ playing on their phones instead of serving us. We waited at the entrance for more than5 min, there are 5 tables max in the whole restaurants. Only time they were fast was to bring us the bill which I just started my dessert, and then I waited for forever to call some one for the machine for my card. The food is very average for the price. Not recommend this place!  \n",

The food it self  tastes was if it were reheated, and absolutely no tast,  it was hard to eat half of my meal. Services was horrible, I waited an hour and a half for my drinks. All of meals came out a different times. When wanting to speak with a supervisor they told me she was in a meeting and continued to be in the meeting for the remainder of the evening there. On the website it states live Dj at 9:30pm. The Dj didn't come in until 11pm.  And didnt get started until 11:30 And by that time I had enough! \\nWouldn't recommend this place at all. Sorry  \n",

The service sucks, waited our food for more than 30 minutes and staff are not friendly. The foods are very salty especially shrimps, lobster taste weird and sirloin is tender but not tasty! It's okey to be costly if the food is good. Very expensive food, not good food! We are all disappointed! Definitely, we're not coming back here at all!!!  \n",

We waited 25 minutes before a server came over to tell us \"it will be a few more minutes\" we had to go over to a random table and ask them to use their menus because we never got any. After 30 mins we got our drinks and then after another 30 mins we got our food. Well not all of us. There were 7 girls at our table and only 5 ordered food- wings and onion rings (doesn't take long in the deep fryer). We were missing a platter and a plate of onion rings- which came another 30 mins later. At this point we asked to see a manager- who honestly did not care at all that we were waiting for this long and that we were basically ignored the whole night. The manager said \"sorry she's kinda new - we can take the platter off the bill and can I make anything else faster for you?\" Well no - that was the last of food and drinks and we had 3 servers at the table how were they all new? he just said \"ok\". \\nWe were a table full of servers so we get it's busy sometimes \\n BUT WORST SERVICE EVER. Not even great \"hooters\" could have fixed this experience. 0.5 star.  \n",

There was a group of approximately 12-15 of us.  My friend heard good things about this restaurant, so she booked the restaurant.\\n\\nWhen we walked in, we were greeted immediately and seated.  The person serving coffee was really kind and came by every 15 minutes to top up coffee.\\n\\nWhen we placed our order, we were surprised that the food was taking a really long time.  Our waiter had done a really poor job of serving our table because after we ordered our food, it took the restaurant over 1.5 hours to serve us.  They had screwed up our order and put us on the bottom of the list.  The last 2 people to join our table got their food and the rest of us waited and waited while other tables who had arrived half hour or more after us, got served their food. \\n\\nWhen I finally got my order of eggs benedict, the eggs were overcooked and the pork was overdone.  It would've been a much more pleasant experience had the waiter brought bread or something to help carry us over until the food arrived when we had asked, but he had completely forgotten about us.\\n\\nThe manager at least comped us for the trouble and bad service.  It's unfortunate because the waiter really should have pushed the kitchen to make our food ahead of the other tables who arrived and ordered an hour after us.  Incredibly disappointing, but glad the manager took the steps to rectify the situation.  \n",

My first time going, I was pleased with the service and my food - I got the beet & goat cheese salad. The next time I went, I ordered the chicken tacos - they were absolutely tasteless. I found the service to be slower, but I was willing to forgive that.\\n\\nWilling to give it another try, I went again this past weekend with a friend. The host at the front door was not all that friendly. He sat us with some other individuals at a table because it was busy (no problem, I don't mind meeting people!). It was about 9:15 and after a long day, we were only just ready for dinner. Not that I should have to justify whether or not I was ordering a drink, but after a long day in the sun, we just ordered food. Our server had attitude when we told her we didn't want a drink at that time. We waited approximately 30 minutes and watched everyone else around us get served. There was no acknowledgment of our waiting (for two salads). \\n\\nMy negative experience is not the only negative one that I have heard about EFW. Needless to say, I won't be back. Sad, because I am so close and it had a lot of potential.  \n",

He told me \" Left side cheese, right side pepperoni. \" I said fine, and waited about 15 min for the order. To my surprise. When I opened the box. The right side had the cheese and the left side had pepperoni. I was extremely disappointed, but I took the pizza home and eat it anyway.  \n",

We were served salad and a jug of water as we waited for our order to arrive. The salad had a hair in it. We all drank the water and realized at the bottom of the jug there were TWO DEAD FLIES. \\n\\nWe told the staff and all they said was sorry. Couldn't bring myself to eat their food, we just got up and left.  Wish I took a picture of it at that time, but I was so traumatized with what had just happened and the waitress quickly came and took the jug away.\\n\\nIf this is what you see in the water and salad, imagine what goes on behind the scenes when they make your food. Hope we don't get sick. Never going there again.  \n",

The chef clearly didn't read my comment. \\n\\nWe waited for thirty minutes after ordering the food, then I asked the waiter why it took so long for our dishes to be served, it turned out that he forgot to log our order into the system. NO APOLOGY WAS GIVEN!! \\n\\nWould not come back, such a disappointing dining experience. The worst part is there were flies fly all over the restaurant.  \n",

I waited 15 minutes at the front counter for some service when the place was not even busy.  three ladies  that work there chit chatting away with their backs towards me didn't  even budge when I  tried to get their attention. Soon they noticed me and they were incredibly rude. I asked them for the snack-size BBQ pig liver but they  rudely replied what is that?? Then I told them the number on the menu and they replied what is that, no we don't have that. just told me to look at the refrigerator.. .  \\n \\n\\n when I wanted to pay , their attitude was so rude and they are once again taking their time literally I waited at the cashier area for so long I wanted to leave...  Because NO SERVICE!! \\n\\n[!!!!!!They also charged me $7.05  for a small box of   duck tongue that's not even 100g.........!!!] \\n\\nI don't get why is it so expensive for not even 100g of duck tongue.. rip off \\n\\nOverall service is rude, slow , unhelpful and expensive, worst experience ever.  \n",

The delivery came pretty quickly. The food tasted reasonably okay (the wings are tiny, don't bother) but there was 1 food item missing. I called Yummy's and a guy at the restaurant acknowledges that the delivery person forgot the item and asked me whether I wanted a refund or a redelivery. He also said that there is another order coming through nearby so the delivery person can drop it off in 45mins. I chose redelivery and was promised that I'd get my order within 45mins. Note: although the person on the phone was polite, he never apologized. \\n\\nI waited for another 70mins and nothing came. I called the restaurant again and was told that turns out no other orders came through near my place and \"we didn't want to send the delivery guy out again because they were busy\". Then I asked why I was not informed of this. They claimed that they had called Tasteaway (which Tasteaway denied ever happening). Again, no apologies, only more excuses. \\n\\nWhile I understand that mistakes happen. A restaurant with decent customer service should understand \\n\\n1) Upon making a mistake, offer an apology  \\n2) Do not make a promise that you cannot keep\\n3) keep your customer INFORMED when plans change\\n4) When you fail to deliver the same thing TWICE, APOLOGIZE\\n\\nNever again.  \n",

We'd been coming here for years. Moved overseas 8 months ago and were looking forward to our favourite brunch place. As is the norm, we waited in line and put our name on the list. I spoke with the lady and asked her how long it would be. She said the wait would be in excess of 30 mins. We're used to this and said ok, we'll come back before that. Left for no more than 15 mins and came back to her informing us that they've closed the kitchen. I reminded her that she had told us it would be over 30 mins. She was short, curt, admitted it was her fault and tried to send me on my way. I explained we were recent expats, had been looking forward to this for a while, two kids in tow who are starving, we were leaving tomorrow so if she could please accommodate us. She was inflexible, was more concerned with shutting down (even though there was still 20 minutes to closing). It's requests like these that seperate establishments that care about the customers from those that just don't care. Thoroughly disappointed. Learn to respect your customers, especially considering you admitted to your mistake.\\n\\nI will never eat at this restaurant again. It's a real shame. You just lost a loving client. For what? One more order? Another 10 minutes of the kitchen being open? Aloof at best, disrespectful at worst. Sad.  \n",

We came here for my sister's birthday-- thought we'd give this place a try since it was close by and the photos looked delicious. \\n\\nIt was freezing in the restaurant - it didn't help that we were seated under a vent, which is fine cause sometimes that's just what you get. Asked for hot tea or hot water to keep warm while we waited for the food and received luke warm water from the tap . \\n\\nFood came and it looked nothing like the photos in the menu. Quite frankly didn't taste that great either. Found a hair in one of our dishes and the waitress apologized and quickly requested another dish for us. However, she did not take away the dish with hair so it was quite unappetizing having a cheesy string of hair stare at us while we sat there freezing. \\n\\nWe finished our meal and had brought a cake to celebrate. What do you know, they refuse to give us a knife and plates. I don't think we've ever been to a restaurant, ever, that didn't allow cake cutting. Sure we've been places where they charge a cake cutting fee, but never a straight up \"no\". Such a great way to end our already not-so-great of an experience. \\n\\nDon't think I'll be coming back here again. At least not to this location.  \n",

The restaurant was half full, and had a maximum of 20 customers. \\n\\nThen, after we Finally got our food, well past our lunch hour, we ate it up at our office. My coworker had diarrhea for the rest of the afternoon, while I just felt nauseous.\\n\\nNever going back again.  \n",

We were in Markham last night and needed to get a quick dinner. The menu in the window showed all the right menu items so we thought why not? It was not crowded so we thought it would be fast...bad mistake. \\nWe ordered for 2 adults and one child a combo for 2 and a 1 person combo.  Cold tofu with preserved egg was good but the idea of bringing side plates to eat a dish meant for sharing seemed foreign to the server. She needed to be asked 3 times and the first time she brought knife and fork instead. Oyster omelette had a big sign in the window. Hardly any oysters in it, not much egg either, mostly fried starch paste. Didn't eat the sauce. Beef noodle soup had small amounts of tough meat, pretty sad for a place that has beef noodle soup in its name. Shaved ice with mangoes was good. The server kept telling stories about how the patrons at the next table drive out of their way to eat theirs. She also had some choice comments about my son's body habitus, which no doubt she will be sharing with other patrons after we are gone. My son didn't like his chicken wing dinner. \\nService was slow....and rude. Each dish brought out at a different time, as if the kitchen could not cook one till it was finished cooking the previous. Drinks the same way. When we were done my husband waited 10 minutes after the server cleared the tables before he went up to find out what was going on. Server had our bill ready but didn't bother to bring it to our table. And the restaurant was mostly empty. Took us over 1 1/2 hours. Bill was over $70, no alcohol. They do not take credit cards so bring cash if you plan to eat here after reading this. We're not coming back.  \n",

The patio filled super quick given it had only just opened but that is not the bar's fault so we took a seat inside for cocktails, the Caesar was good! \\n\\nA few cocktails later we were hungry and  the food did look good. One of our group had eaten here before and said it was fine. So I started trying to obtain menu's. This was a considerable task as up until this point the service had been pretty rubbish and slow...it wan't that busy either. So after being ignored several times, I went and found menus for the table. \\n\\nWe decided on what we all would like to eat then waited about 15 minutes to get a server. The server only approached us as she wanted the menu's we had, I said we were ready to order and she said I will be back in 2 minutes to take the order...now don't get me wrong I did not expect her back in 2 minutes...but 10 minutes later and we are still getting ignored by her as she passes our table countless times...ridiculous. \\n\\nWe decided at this point to get the bill and leave, go get food elsewhere. Awful, awful service. I will not be returning any time soon  \n",
       "331345  I sympathize with the other reviewers as i had a similar or worse experience today at this horrible place. I should have checked this page before going there. Anyway, i present the voucher and 5 min later the manager comes up to me and i could barely undeetand what he was saying as his english was like 1/10 but this is what i got from it.. They dont accept those vouchers anymore because of some dilemma they have with dealfind and they overbooked reservations or something. Should NOT be the customers concern. Anyway, just like the other reviewer said, they told me to go on the website and get a refund. DESPITE the hard time they gave us, we were hungry and decided to order anyway.. The weitress (whom may i add was either on a hard dose of methane or just really stoned, and also did not speak english nor could comprehend the menu at the restaurant where she works) had to come back 3 times and have me repeat my order because she couldnt be bothered to write it down the frst time...NOR the second or third.. It wasnt even as if we were ordering so much, only 3 damn items!! But she didnt even have a pen and a pad to begin with. On top of all that, when we came in and waited for a while for someone to seat us, no one did despite the fact that the restaurant was empty in the midst of a mid afternoon, we ended up seating ourselves. Yes i know there were red flags all around but cognitive dissonance prevented us from leaving until we were just literally fed up!!! And we never just up and leave.. Oh and when i asked about those complimentary apetizer plates, she didnt know what i was talking about. This place is hands down shit and i wouldnt recommed it to my worst enemy on earth. What a waste of time. Btw, i dont usually write reviews so you know this lengthy review is the outcome of severe devastation. Im also typing on my ipad which isnt as easy as on a regular keyboard. Anywho, the first red flag was the fact that all tables were EMPTY.. But its definately no surprise !!!!! The weitress herself told us this is not the first incident where people leave hungry and frustrated. Gee u think? I dont know how this place is still holding up quite honestly, but i can see it closing down very soon. I ended up writing to dealfind immediately, basically stating my frustration and demanding a freakin refund. STAY AWAY!!!!!!  "
